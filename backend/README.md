## Frontend and Backend bugs 1.0
During production of this app, was group was split into the front and backend. 

Issues in the frontend, include React Native Navigation, rendering and displaying information from the database, ensuring the frontend user inputs matched the backend routes and services.

Issues in the backend, during the creation of the database, migrations were problematic at times due to the mislabelling of columns. Other issues included dealing with the slow speed of AWS instances, ensuring we have up to date data for the app. Writing data into our database so that querying time is reduced.
